# Introduction

In this project you will recreate classic game of space invaders

_introduction to pygame zero_

# Step 1
First create a game window in which we can draw 

	```python
	WIDTH = 500
	HEIGHT = 500

	def draw():
		screen.clear()
	```

First we need to make an image for the player ship, using a paint package.
Something like this:

	![Player ship](ship.png)
